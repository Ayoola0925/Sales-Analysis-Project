## Project Overview

This project explores sales data to uncover key trends, identify growth opportunities, and address performance gaps. Using Power BI, I transformed raw data into an interactive dashboard, providing actionable insights for better decision-making.

### Data Source

Financial Data: The primary data used for this analysis is the "Financial_data.csv" file, containing datailed information about sales of each products and countries.

### Tools

- Excel  - Data cleaning
- PowerBI  - Creating reports

 
 ### Data Cleaning/preparation
  
  In this phase,I performmed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading and importation
  2. Data cleaning and formatting.
 
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this project, EDA was conducted to explore the financial data and uncover meaningful insights. Key questions addressed during the analysis include:

1. Data Quality and Overview
- Are there missing values or duplicate entries in the dataset?
- Are the data types correctly formatted (e.g., numeric, categorical)?
- Are there any outliers or anomalies in sales, profit, or discount data?
2. Product Performance
- Which products generate the highest and lowest revenue?
- Which products have the highest and lowest profit margins?
- Are there products with high sales volumes but low profitability?
3. Regional Performance
- Which regions report the highest sales and profit?
- Are there regions with high sales but low profit margins (e.g., Canada)?
- How does performance vary across regions, and are there opportunities for expansion?
4. Customer Segments
- Which customer segments contribute the most to sales and profit?
- Are there segments where product performance is particularly strong or weak?
- How do different segments respond to discounts or promotions?
5. Sales and Profitability Patterns
- What is the correlation between sales and profit?
- How do discounts impact profit margins?
- Are there seasonal patterns or trends across regions and segments?
6. Inventory and Demand Forecasting
- Are there products with high stock levels but low sales?
- Are sales aligned with inventory levels, or are there stockouts or excess inventory?
- How can inventory management be optimized to match demand patterns?
7. Pricing and Discounts
- How do discounts vary across regions and segments?
- Are products with higher discounts achieving higher sales but lower profit margins?
- What is the optimal discount level to maximize both sales and profit?
8. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Profit Margins
- Which products have the highest COGS, and how does it impact profit margins?
- Are there opportunities to reduce COGS without compromising quality?
- How does COGS vary by product, segment, and region?

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Results
1. Product Performance
Question: Which products generate the highest and lowest revenue?

Paseo: Highest revenue generator with 33M, making it a key product for continued investment.
Carretera: Lowest revenue with 14M and 1.8M profit margin, signaling a need for optimization or repositioning.
Question: Are there products with high sales volume but low profitability?

Yes, Carretera's high sales do not align with its low profit margin, indicating a potential pricing or product issue.

2. Regional Performance
Question: Which regions have the highest and lowest sales and profit?

Canada: Highest units sold (247,427) but low profit (3.5M), suggesting profitability issues.
France: Highest profit (3.78M) with fewer units sold (240,932), indicating a premium market with potential for growth.
Question: Are there regions with high sales but low profit margins?

Yes, Canada has high sales volume but low profitability.
Question: How does performance vary across regions, and are there opportunities for market expansion?

Germany has significant profit (3.68M) but the lowest sales volume (201,494)—a strong opportunity for expansion.
Mexico has moderate sales but the lowest profit margin (2.9M), pointing to challenges in pricing or market dynamics.

3. Customer Segments
Question: Which customer segments contribute the most to sales and profit?

Government and Small Business segments are key drivers of sales.
Paseo performs strongly in these segments, suggesting where future investments should focus.
Question: Are there any segments where product performance is particularly strong or weak?

Paseo dominates, while other products like Carretera struggle in profitability.

4. Profitability Patterns
Question: What is the correlation between sales and profit?

Higher sales for Paseo correlate with high profits, but Carretera shows poor profit margins despite sales volume.
Question: How do discounts impact profit margins?

There is room to optimize discounts to improve profit margins, particularly for products like Carretera.

5. Discounting and Pricing Opportunities
Question: What is the optimal discount level to maximize both sales and profit?

Preliminary analysis suggests opportunities to fine-tune discounts across segments and regions to balance profit and revenue growth.

6. Inventory and Demand Forecasting
Question: Are sales aligned with inventory levels, or are there stockouts or excess inventory?

Insights indicate areas where demand forecasting and inventory management can be improved.
Question: How can inventory management be optimized?

Aligning stock levels with revenue patterns can reduce excess inventory and prevent stockouts.

7. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Profit Margins
Question: Which products have the highest COGS, and how does it impact profit margins?

Carretera likely has high COGS, contributing to its low profit margins.
Question: Are there opportunities to reduce COGS without sacrificing quality?

Yes, optimizing COGS is a key area for improving profitability.

### Recommendations
